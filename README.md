## Adventure Works Sales Report 
This is a guided project done as a part of learning Power BI.
In this project, a sales report is created using Power BI.   
While doing this project, I was able to learn:

* Create calendar table
* Create a data model
* Add calculated columns
* Add explicit measures
* Create visualizations
* Add slicers
* Apply conditional formatting to tables and matrices
* DAX functions such as SUM, CALCULATE, QUARTER, DAY, DIVIDE
